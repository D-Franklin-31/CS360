Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The goal of the Inventory App was to provide users with a simple and efficient way to manage and track their inventory. It was designed for individuals or small businesses who need to organize items, monitor quantities, and receive alerts when stock is running low. The app helps users stay on top of inventory without needing internet access or complex systems.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful? 

To support user needs, the app included the many screens. A login/registration screen to manage user access. A main screen welcoming users. A data display screen with a grid layout for viewing inventory items. An add/edit item screen to input new items or update existing ones. An SMS alert feature to notify users when an item’s quantity drops below a threshold. The UI was designed to be clean, minimal, and intuitive. Elements were logically grouped, and buttons were clearly labeled. The use of a RecyclerView allowed users to scan through inventory quickly, while forms were kept simple to reduce friction. These design choices kept the user’s experience in focus and helped ensure usability across skill levels.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?

I approached coding by breaking down each feature into smaller, manageable components. I started with database setup, then implemented UI navigation, followed by CRUD operations. I made sure to keep logic organized in separate classes to promote maintainability. I used structured Java naming conventions and added inline comments to improve code readability. This step-by-step method helped prevent bugs and allowed me to test each part independently.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

I tested my code using the Android Emulator to simulate different user interactions and permission outcomes. I also tested CRUD functionality by adding, updating, and deleting inventory items. This process was essential because it revealed logic gaps and small UI issues early. One of the biggest challenges was integrating the SMS feature while making sure the app didn’t crash if permission was denied.

In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

The component that best demonstrated my skills was the full integration of the RecyclerView with CRUD operations and SMS alerts.
